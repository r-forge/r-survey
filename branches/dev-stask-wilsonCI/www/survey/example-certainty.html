    <h1>Specifying certainty PSUs</h1>

In many national surveys there will be major cities that are sampled
with certainty (eg New York) and then subsampled.  In addition to the
usual work-arounds such as treating the second-stage units as PSUs,
the survey package has two ways to specify certainty PSUs
directly.</p>

The best way to specify certainty PSUs is to use a finite population
correction and specify the first-stage population size as 1 for that
stratum.
