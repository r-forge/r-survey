<h2>Options for the survey package</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This help page documents the options that control the behaviour of
the survey package.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
All the options for the survey package have names beginning with
"survey".  Three of them control standard error estimation.
</p>
<p>
When <code>options("survey.ultimate.cluster")</code> is <code>TRUE</code>,
standard error estimation is based on independence of PSUs at the
first stage of sampling, without using any information about
subsequent stages (this is what Stata (before version 9) and many
other packages do). When <code>FALSE</code>, finite population corrections
and variances are estimated recursively. See <code><a href="svyrecvar.html">svyrecvar</a></code>
for more information.
</p>
<p>
Handling of strata with a single PSU that are not certainty PSUs is
controlled by <code>options("survey.lonely.psu")</code>. The default
setting is <code>"fail"</code>, which gives an error. Use <code>"remove"</code>
to ignore that PSU for variance computation, <code>"adjust"</code> to
center the stratum at the population mean rather than the stratum
mean, and <code>"average"</code> to replace the variance contribution of
the stratum by the average variance contribution across strata.
</p>
<p>
The variance formulas for domain estimation give well-defined,
positive results when a stratum contains only one PSU with
observations in the domain, but are not unbiased.  If
<code>options("survey.adjust.domain.lonely")</code> is <code>TRUE</code> and
<code>options("survey.lonely.psu")</code> is <code>"average"</code> or
<code>"adjust"</code> the same adjustment for lonely PSUs will be used
within a domain. Note that this adjustment is not available for
replicate-weight designs, nor (currently) for raked,
post-stratified, or calibrated designs.
</p>
<p>
The fourth option is <code>options("survey.want.obsolete")</code>. This
controls the warnings about using the deprecated pre-2.9.0 survey
design objects.
