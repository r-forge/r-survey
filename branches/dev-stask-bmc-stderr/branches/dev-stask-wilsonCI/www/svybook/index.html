This is the web site for the book <em>Complex Surveys: a guide to 
analysis 
using R</em>, published by <a 
href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470284307,descCd-description.html">Wiley.</a>  

<p><strong>Now <a 
href="http://www.amazon.com/Complex-Surveys-Analysis-Methodology-ebook/dp/B005PS6C9A/">available</a> 
for the Kindle</strong> (Sept 2011)<p>

 The initial price will be 
about half what is charged for 
most survey sampling texts. It is 
softcover, which explains part of the lower price.  If you are concerned 
that price reflects quality, then just wait a year or so and the price 
should be higher. <p>


You can download the <a href="toc.pdf">table of contents</a> and <a 
href="preface.pdf">preface</a> to see what is in the book, and why. The 
book is based around the <a href="../survey/">R survey package</a>, and 
includes a lot of code, a lot of data, and relatively few formulas.

<strong>Not quite all the data sets are up here yet...</strong><p>

<h2>Data</h2>
Data sets used in exercises in the book. Many of these are of realistic 
size, ie, <strong>large</strong>
<ul>
<li> The California Schools/Academic Performance Index population and 
samples are built into the survey package. Load them with 
<code>data(api)</code>.  [At the moment this does not include 
<tt>apisrs</tt> which you can <a 
href="apisrs.rda">download here</a>]
<li> <a href="nhanesimp.zip">NHANES III imputations</a>(31Mb) in SQLite 
format.

<li> various <a href="nhanesxpt.zip">XPORT files</a>(10Mb) from NHANES <a

book), and the <a href="CHIS_PUF_dictionary.pdf">documentation</a>
<li> Data from SIPP, the <a href="http://www.census.gov/sipp/">Survey of 
Income and Program Participation</a>, wave 1 of the 1996 panel, in a

<li> The PPS sample of US election data used in section 3.3 and the 
population it came from 
are built in to the survey package and can be loaded with 
<code>data(election)</code>
<li> The map examples based on BRFSS data used the version of the BRFSS 
GIS data that was available in late 2008.  In March 2009 the data file was 
changed, omitting the FIPS codes. To make the map code in the book work, 
you need <a href="BRFSS2007.zip">the old version</a>. 
<li> Data (<a href="mscm.txt">mscm.txt</a>) from the Mothers' and 
Children's Morbidity Study, used in Chapter 10. These data were obtained 
from Patrick Heagerty's <a 
href="http://faculty.washington.edu/heagerty/Books/AnalysisLongitudinal/">web 
site</a> for <em>Analysis of Longitudinal Data</em> by Diggle, Heagerty, 
Liang & Zeger.

database</a>.

<h2>Graphs</h2>
<ul>
<li> Color plots of the 2004 US election: a sample of 5000 votes, colored 
and jittered, with <a href="elections-dot.png">dots</a> or <a 
href="elections-trans.png">transparent circles</a>. A color version of 
Figure 3.1, mentioned in section 4.6.1
<li> <a href="transparent-coplot.png">Coplot</a> of systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure by age and sex, data 
from NHANES 2003-2004, mentioned in section 4.5 of the book.
<li> <a href="maps-webpage.R">code</a> for the combined city/count BRFSS 
maps at the end of chapter 4.  This uses the <a 
href="http://www.cdc.gov/BRfss/maps/gis_data.htm">CDC 'SMART'</a> data 
<li> <a href="insurance.pdf">Health insurance by state and age</a>, a 
color version of Figure 4.24. Unfortunately, the CDC have modified the 
'SMART' GIS data to exclude the FIPS codes for states. To make the code 
in the 
book work, you need <a href="BRFSS2007.zip">the old version</a>
<li> <a href="maps-webpage.R">Code</a> for Figures 4.25 and 4.26, and 
other variations on maps with both city and state data.  These need the <a 
href="BRFSS2007.zip">the old version</a> of the BRFSS GIS data (with FIPS 
codes). Unzip the file in a subdirectory called <tt>GIS</tt> and run the 
code in the parent directory.  
 </ul>

<h3> Other books you might prefer</h3>
Some (otherwise) reasonable people think that a book on survey analysis 
should have lots of formulas, shouldn't be tied to a particular 
software system, and should be written by someone with more of a 
publication record in 
survey methodology.  There are many excellent books available that satisfy 
these criteria, and I can recommend the following three from personal 
experience:
 <ul>
<li> For an improved version of the standard undergraduate course, <a 
href="http://math.la.asu.edu/~lohr/">Sharon Lohr's</a> <em>Sampling: 
Design and Analysis</em>.  The second edition has just appeared, and 
expands the areas covered. It includes code in SAS, which some people will 
see another added feature.
 Tobias Verbeke had <a 
href="http://cran.fhcrc.org/web/packages/SDaA/index.html">packaged the 
data sets and exercises</a> in the first edition for R.
<li> For mathematical details, <a 
href="http://www.amazon.com/Assisted-Survey-Sampling-Springer-Statistics/dp/0387406204">Model 
Assisted Survey Sampling</a> by Sarndal, Swensson, and Wretman. This is 
the main reference for formulas in my book.
<li> If you are not interested in R or in doing your own two-phase 
designs, 
<a 
href="http://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Health-Surveys-Survey-Methodology/dp/0471137731">Analysis 
of Health Surveys</a> by Korn and Graubard covers fairly similar topics 
to my book, with slightly more mathematics.
