    <h1>Specifying a survey design</h1>

Survey designs are specified using the <a
href="html/svydesign.html">svydesign</a>
function.  The main arguments to the the function are <tt>id</tt> to
specify sampling units (PSUs and optionally later stages),
<tt>strata</tt> to specify strata, <tt>weights</tt> to specify sampling
weights, and <tt>fpc</tt> to specify finite population size
corrections.  These arguments should be given as formulas, referring to
columns in a data frame given as the <tt>data</tt> argument.</p>

The resulting survey design object contains all the data and meta-data needed for analysis, and will be supplied as an argument to analysis functions.</p>


The survey package contains several subsamples from the California
Academic Performance Index, in the <a href="html/api.html">api</a> data set. First, we load
these data:
<pre>
  data(api)
</pre>


The <tt>apistrat</tt> data frame has stratified independent sample
<pre>
dstrat <- svydesign(id=~1,strata=~stype, weights=~pw, data=apistrat, fpc=~fpc)
</pre>
stratified on <tt>stype</tt>, with sampling weights <tt>pw</tt>. The
<tt>fpc</tt> variable contains the population size for the stratum.

As the schools are sampled independently, each record in the data frame
is a separate PSU.  This is indicated by <tt>id=~1</tt>.  Since the
sampling weights could have been determined from the population size an
equivalent declaration would be
<pre>
dstrat <- svydesign(id=~1,strata=~stype,  data=apistrat, fpc=~fpc)
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>apiclus1</tt> data frame is a cluster sample: all schools in a
random sample of school districts.
<pre>
dclus1 <- svydesign(id=~dnum, weights=~pw, data=apiclus1, fpc=~fpc)
</pre>
There is no <tt>strata</tt> argument as the sampling was not
stratified. The variable <tt>dnum</tt> identifies school districts
(PSUs) and is specified as the <tt>id</tt> argument.
 Again, the <tt>weights</tt> argument is optional, as the sampling
 weights can be computed from the population size.

To specify sampling with replacement, simply omit the <tt>fpc</tt> argument:
<pre>
dclus1 <- svydesign(id=~dnum, weights=~pw, data=apiclus1)
</pre>
<p>

A design may have strata and clusters. In that case <tt>svydesign</tt>
assumes that the clusters are numbered uniquely across the entire
sample, rather than just within a stratum. This enables some sorts of
data errors to be detected.  If your clusters are only numbered
uniquely within a stratum use the option <tt>nest=TRUE</tt> to specify
this and disable the checking.<p>


The <tt>apiclus2</tt> data set contains a two-stage cluster sample. First, school districts were sampled. If there were fewer than five schools in the district, all were taken, otherwise a random sample of five.
<pre>
dclus2<-svydesign(id=~dnum+snum, fpc=~fpc1+fpc2, data=apiclus2)
</pre>
The multistage nature of the sampling is clear in the <tt>id</tt> and <tt>fpc</tt> arguments. At the first stage the sampling units are identified by <tt>dnum</tt> and the population size by <tt>fpc1</tt>.  At the second stage, units within each school district are identified by <tt>snum</tt> and the number of units within the district by <tt>fpc2</tt>.

When a finite population correction is not given, and sampling is with replacement, only the first stage of the design is needed. The following two declarations are equivalent for treating the two-stage cluster design as if the first stage were with replacement.
<pre>
dclus2wr <- svydesign(id=~dnum+snum, weights=~pw, data=apiclus2)
dclus2wr2 <- svydesign(id=~dnum, weights=~pw, data=apiclus2)
</pre>
