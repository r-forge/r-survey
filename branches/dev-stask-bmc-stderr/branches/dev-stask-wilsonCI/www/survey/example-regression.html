    <h1>Regression models</h1>

Generalized linear models, including the linear model, are estimated
by <a
href="html/svyglm.html"><tt>svyglm</tt></a>.
This has almost the same arguments as <tt>glm</tt>, the difference being 
that the <tt>data</tt> argument to <tt>glm</tt> is replaced by a 
<tt>design</tt> argument to <tt>svyglm</tt>. Similarly, <a 
href="html/svycoxph.html">svycoxph</a> 
fits Cox models to survey data.<p>

In this example we use the <tt>dclus2</tt> two-stage cluster sample from the California Academic Performance Index, which was <a href="example-design.html">created in an earlier example</tt></a>.  The syntax and options for <tt>svyglm</tt> are the same for designs with and without replicate weights.<p>

The outcome variable is 2000 API, predicted by the proportions of students learning English (<tt>ell</tt>), receiving subsidized means  (<tt>means</tt>) and having moved to the school within the past year (<tt>mobility</tt>).  This is a linear regression model, so no <tt>family</tt> argument to <tt>svyglm</tt> is needed.
<pre>
 > summary(svyglm(api00 ~ ell + meals + mobility, design = dclus2))

 Call:
 svyglm.survey.design(formula = api00 ~ ell + meals + mobility,
     design = dclus2)

 Survey design:
 svydesign(id = ~dnum + snum, weights = ~pw, data = apiclus2)

 Coefficients:
             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)

A useful property of regression models is that they provide another way to get domain estimates.  Suppose we want the mean of <tt>api00</tt> for each school type:
<pre>
 >  summary(svyglm(api00~stype-1, dclus2))

 Call:
 svyglm.survey.design(formula = api00 ~ stype - 1, design = dclus2)

 Survey design:
 svydesign(id = ~dnum + snum, weights = ~pw, data = apiclus2)

 Coefficients:
        Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
 stypeE   692.81      30.28   22.88   <2e-16 ***
 stypeH   598.34      16.96   35.27   <2e-16 ***
 stypeM   642.35      45.34   14.17   <2e-16 ***
 ---
 Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
 
 (Dispersion parameter for gaussian family taken to be 17389.33)

 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 2

 > svyby(~api00,~stype,dclus2,svymean, keep.var=TRUE)
   stype statistic.api00       SE
 E     E        692.8104 30.28244
 H     H        598.3407 16.96500
 M     M        642.3520 45.34363
</pre>
This equivalence helps in thinking about domain estimators and how they handle more complex designs.
