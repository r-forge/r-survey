    <h1>Tests in contingency tables</h1>

R implements two types of test for association in two-way tables, each with further variants.  The first type is  tests based on the Pearson chi-squared statistic, using theory developed by JNK Rao and Scott. (Annals of Statistics 12:46-60).<p>

A X^2 statistic computed from an estimated  population table is too large, because the effective sample size is much smaller than the population size. Even after rescaling, its distribution is not exactly chi-squared. However, a chi-squared or F distribution for the rescaled statistic give reasonable approximations.  The default is the F distribution, the "second-order Rao-Scott adjustment".<p>

Using the <tt>dclus1</tt> design object constructed in an earlier example we examine whether the proportion of schools meeting their "school-wide growth target" is different by school type. We use the default second-order adjustment and the first-order adjustment (the chi-squared approximation).

 > svychisq(~sch.wide + stype, dclus1)

         Pearson's X^2: Rao & Scott adjustment

 data:  svychisq(~sch.wide + stype, dclus1)
 F = 5.1934, ndf = 1.495, ddf = 20.925, p-value = 0.02175


 > svychisq(~sch.wide + stype, dclus1, statistic = "Chisq")

         Pearson's X^2: Rao & Scott adjustment

 data:  svychisq(~sch.wide + stype, dclus1, statistic = "Chisq")
 X-squared = 11.9409, df = 2, p-value = 0.005553
</pre>
<p>


The other type of test is a Wald test based on the differences between
the observed cell counts and those expected under independence (Koch
et al, International Statistical Review 43: 59-78).  I believe the
<tt>statistic="Wald"</tt> test is the one used by SUDAAN. Using <tt>statistic="adjWald"</tt> reduces the statistic when the number of PSUs is small compared to the number of degrees of freedom. Rao & Thomas (JASA 82:630-636) recommend the adjusted version.
<pre>
 > svychisq(~sch.wide+stype, dclus1, statistic="adjWald")
 
         Design-based Wald test of association

 data:  svychisq(~sch.wide + stype, dclus1, statistic = "adjWald")
 F = 2.2296, ndf = 2, ddf = 13, p-value = 0.1471

 > svychisq(~sch.wide+stype, dclus1, statistic="Wald")

         Design-based Wald test of association

 data:  svychisq(~sch.wide + stype, dclus1, statistic = "Wald")
 F = 2.4011, ndf = 2, ddf = 14, p-value = 0.1269
</pre>

Both types of test are also available for designs with replicate
weights. As the number of clusters is not available with replicate
weights the degrees of freedom are based on the rank of the matrix of
replicate weights.
