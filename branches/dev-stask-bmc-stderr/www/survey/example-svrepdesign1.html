    <h1>Using replicate weights</h1>

Replicate weights present in the data file can be specified as an
argument to <a
href="html/svrepdesign.html">svrepdesign</a>, but it is also possible to create replicate weights from a survey design object.<p>

As an example we use data from <a 
href="http://www.stata-press.com/data/r9/svy.html">Stata</a>, based on 
the NHANES 2 study.  This data file has a set of 32 replicates based on 
the BRR method.<p>

The replicate weights are in columns 56 to 87 of the data file. In this 
case it is easiest to specify the variables and replicate weights as 
separate data frames rather than as formulas.  The overall analysis 
weights are in the variable <tt>finalwgt</tt> and this is specified as 
the <tt>weights</tt> argument.  The BRR weights already incorporate the 
analysis weights (ie they are <tt>2*finalwgt</tt> and <tt>0</tt> rather 
than <tt>2</tt> and <tt>0</tt>), so we use 
<tt>combined.weights=TRUE</tt>

> hanes<-read.dta("nhanes2brr.dta")
> brrhanes<-svrepdesign(variables=hanes[,1:55], 
repweights=hanes[,56:87], type="BRR",combined.weights=TRUE,
weights=hanes$finalwgt)
> brrhanes
Call: svrepdesign(variables = hanes[, 1:55], repweights = hanes[, 
56:87], 
    type = "BRR", combined.weights = TRUE, weights = hanes$finalwgt)
Balanced Repeated Replicates with 32 replicates.

The <tt>summary</tt> method shows the variable names.
<pre>
> summary(brrhanes)
Call: svrepdesign(variables = hanes[, 1:55], repweights = hanes[, 
56:87], 
    type = "BRR", combined.weights = TRUE, weights = hanes$finalwgt)

We can now compute some summary statistics
