    <h1>Creating replicate weights</h1>

Replicate weights present in the data file can be specified as an
argument to <a
href="html/svrepdesign.html">svrepdesign</a>, but it is also possible to create replicate weights from a survey design object.<p>

There are three types of replicate weight that can be created with <a
href="html/as.svrepdesign.html">as.svrepdesign</a>.
Jackknife (JK1 and JKn) weights omit one PSU at a time. Balanced
repeated replicates (BRR and Fay) omit or downweight half the
sample. Bootstrap replicates resample PSUs from an estimated
population.


All these types of weights are created by <tt>as.svrepdesign</tt>,
according to the <tt>type</tt> argument. The default is JK1 weights for
an unstratified sample and JKn for a stratified sample. </p>

Here we <a href="example-design.html">create a survey design object</a> using the one-stage cluster sample from the California Academic Performance Index.
<pre>
 data(api)
 dclus1<-svydesign(id=~dnum, weights=~pw, data=apiclus1, fpc=~fpc)
</pre> </p>

Converting this design to use unstratified jackknife (JK1) weights is as simple as
<pre>
 rclus1<-as.svrepdesign(dclus1)
</pre>
To convert to bootstrap weights, specify the <tt>type</tt> and the number of bootstrap replicates.
<pre>
 bclus1 <- as.svrepdesign(dclus1,type="bootstrap", replicates=100)
</pre> </p>


Balanced Repeated Replicates are designed for surveys with two PSUs in
each stratum (although <tt>as.svrepdesign</tt> will attempt to handle
some other designs.  Within each replicate each stratum of the sample
is split into halves, in a complex design that ensures two PSUs from
different strata are in the same half-sample for exactly half the
replicates.  </p>

This "complete orthogonal balance" is possible only when the number of
replicates is a multiple of 4, larger than the number of strata.  Even
then, constructing a suitable set of replicates may be difficult. The
survey package will sometimes use <a href="hadamard-sizes.png">more
replicates</a> than are strictly necessary.</p>


Here we create a design from a small data set with 2 PSUs in each stratum.
<pre>
 data(scd)
 scdnofpc<-svydesign(data=scd, prob=~1, id=~ambulance, strata=~ESA,
                     nest=TRUE)
</pre>
To convert to use BRR weights, we specify <tt>type="BRR"</tt>.
<pre>
 scd2brr <- as.svrepdesign(scdnofpc, type="BRR")
</pre></p>


Fay's method is a modified version of BRR that uses weights of 2-&rho; and &rho; rather than 2 and 0 for PSUs in and not in  a particular half-sample.
<pre>
 scd2fay <- as.svrepdesign(scdnofpc, type="Fay",fay.rho=0.3)
</pre>
